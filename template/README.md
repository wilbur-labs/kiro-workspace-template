# kiro-workspace-template

A multi-agent workspace architecture for [kiro-cli](https://github.com/kirocli/kiro).

Organize multiple AI agents, shared context, learned memories, skills, and task tracking in a single workspace.

## Key Concepts

### Agents (`.kiro/agents/`)

Each agent is a JSON file defining:
- `name` / `description`
- `prompt` — system prompt (inline or `file://` reference)
- `tools` — available tools
- `resources` — files/skills loaded into context
- `hooks.agentSpawn` — commands run on session start (e.g., load RESUME.md)

### Shared Context (`.kiro/shared/SHARED-CONTEXT.md`)

Information shared across all agents: environment info, credentials references, team members, common URLs.

### Learned Memories (`.kiro/learned/LEARNED.md`)

Auto-appended experience entries. Format:
```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] AgentName — Title
Brief description (1-3 lines)
```

### Skills (`.kiro/skills/`)

Reusable instruction documents that agents reference. Examples:
- `auto-learn.md` — when/how to record learnings
- `delegate-to-local-llm.md` — rules for delegating to local models
- `output-templates.md` — commit message, MR description formats

### Tasks (`tasks/`)

Each task has:
- `RESUME.md` — current state, read on session start for continuity
- `WORKFLOW.md` — process steps, variables, stage definitions
- `task.yaml` — metadata (optional)

## Usage

1. Copy this template to your workspace
2. Edit `.kiro/shared/SHARED-CONTEXT.md` with your environment info
3. Create agent definitions in `.kiro/agents/`
4. Define tasks in `tasks/<task-name>/`
5. Run `kiro-cli chat --agent <name>` to start working

## Session Recovery

Agents read `RESUME.md` on spawn via hooks. This ensures continuity across sessions without relying on conversation history.

## AI-DLC Integration

This template includes [AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle)](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows) v0.1.8 rules.

AI-DLC provides a structured three-phase workflow:
- **Inception** — Requirements analysis, user stories, architecture design
- **Construction** — Detailed design, code generation, testing
- **Operations** — Deployment and monitoring

Rules are in English but the agent communicates in Chinese (configured in `SHARED-CONTEXT.md`).

To trigger the workflow, start your request with: **"Using AI-DLC, ..."**

Verify rules are loaded: run `kiro-cli`, then `/context show`, and confirm entries for `.kiro/steering/aws-aidlc-rules`.
